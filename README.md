# Offroad-RC-Car
Arduino program controlling the Electronic systems of an RC car.     
This was written in C++ (or the arduino programming language) and developed for the InSchools 4x4 Tech challenge in the UAE.    
The program runs on an arduino uno and utilises multiple sensors and other modules to run the electronics of the RC car.   
These include a gyroscope to sense if the car is overtilting, automtic headlights, a towbar controlled via bluetooth using a mobile applciation, and a proximity alert warning using an LED Matrix display.   
The complete car was later developed physically with the arduino and all its sensors mounted on it.
